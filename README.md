## About the Project
The Pre-Calculus Mastery Application is a mobile application designed to gamify
the learning of pre-calculus concepts. This interactive platform encourages user
engagement through a reward-based system similar to Duolingo, where users earn lives
for correct answers and unlock additional quizzes and lessons. Our comprehensive 
curriculum covers functions, trigonometry, limits, derivatives, and integrals, aiming
to enhance learning and retention through interactive lessons and practice problems.
